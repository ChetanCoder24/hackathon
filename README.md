This project is a sentiment analysis tool that aggregates and analyzes public opinions from multiple online platformsâ€”Reddit, Quora, and news articles. Using Python libraries like Newspaper for web scraping and TextBlob for natural language processing, it performs real-time sentiment analysis on search results. The data is visualized using matplotlib, displaying sentiment scores in bar charts for easy understanding. The project features a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to input queries, view links, and see sentiment trends in real time. It can be scaled up with more data sources, advanced visualizations, and improved processing capabilities.
